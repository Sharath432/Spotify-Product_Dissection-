Spotify Schema Design for PostgreSQL
Overview
This repository contains a PostgreSQL schema design for a simplified version of Spotify, a leading audio streaming platform. The project is part of a case study on product dissection, analyzing Spotify's core features, real-world problem-solving capabilities, and data architecture. The schema captures key entities, attributes, and relationships that support Spotify’s functionality, such as music streaming, playlist creation, and user interactions. The implementation includes SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements to set up the database and populate it with sample data.
Project Context
This project was developed as part of a case study to:

Analyze Spotify’s standout features (e.g., personalized recommendations, offline mode, artist tools).
Address real-world challenges like content discovery and artist exposure.
Design a relational database schema to support these features.
Provide a foundation for creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.

The schema is designed to be scalable, flexible, and aligned with Spotify’s user-centric and artist-supportive objectives.
Schema Description
The database schema consists of the following entities, capturing Spotify’s core functionalities:

Users: Represents Spotify users (listeners or artists) with attributes like UserID, Username, Email, Profile_Picture_URL, Subscription_Type, and Registration_Date.
Artists: Represents musicians or podcast creators with attributes like ArtistID, Name, Bio, and Follower_Count.
Albums: Represents music albums or podcast series with attributes like AlbumID, Title, ArtistID, and Release_Date.
Tracks: Represents individual songs or podcast episodes with attributes like TrackID, Title, ArtistID, AlbumID, Genre, Duration, Stream_Count, and Release_Date.
Playlists: Represents user-curated or algorithm-generated playlists with attributes like PlaylistID, UserID, Title, Creation_Date, and Is_Collaborative.
PlaylistTracks: Manages the many-to-many relationship between playlists and tracks with attributes like PlaylistTrackID, PlaylistID, and TrackID.
Follows: Represents follow relationships between users or between users and artists with attributes like FollowID, FollowerUserID, FollowedUserID, FollowedArtistID, and Follow_Date.

Relationships

One-to-Many: 
Users create multiple Playlists.
Artists create multiple Tracks and Albums.
Albums contain multiple Tracks.


Many-to-Many:
Playlists contain multiple Tracks (via PlaylistTracks).
Users follow multiple Artists or Users (via Follows).



Files

spotify_schema.sql: Contains the SQL code to create the tables and insert sample data into the PostgreSQL database. It includes:
CREATE TABLE statements for all entities with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Sample INSERT statements to populate the tables with example data for testing.



Setup Instructions
To set up the Spotify schema in your PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

Install PostgreSQL:

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your system. Download it from postgresql.org if needed.
Verify installation by running psql --version in your terminal.


Create a Database:

Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., psql, pgAdmin, or DBeaver).
Create a new database:CREATE DATABASE spotify_db;


Connect to the database:\c spotify_db




Set Up the Schema:

Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-schema.git
cd spotify-schema


Run the spotify_schema.sql file to create tables and insert sample data:psql -U your-username -d spotify_db -f spotify_schema.sql

Replace your-username with your PostgreSQL username.


Verify the Setup:

Query the tables to ensure they are created and populated:SELECT * FROM Users;
SELECT * FROM Tracks;





Generating an ER Diagram
To visualize the schema as an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram:

Using pgAdmin:
Open pgAdmin, connect to spotify_db, and navigate to the schema.
Right-click on the schema, select "ERD Tool," and generate the diagram.


Using DBeaver:
Import the database into DBeaver, select the schema, and use the "ER Diagrams" tab to create a diagram.


Using dbdiagram.io:
Copy the CREATE TABLE statements from spotify_schema.sql into dbdiagram.io to generate an ER diagram.


Using Miro:
Manually draw the ER diagram with entities (rectangles), attributes (ovals), and relationships (diamonds) based on the schema description.



Usage

Testing the Schema: Use the sample data to test queries, such as retrieving a user’s playlists or finding tracks in a specific genre:-- Get all tracks in a playlist
SELECT t.Title, a.Name
FROM Tracks t
JOIN PlaylistTracks pt ON t.TrackID = pt.TrackID
JOIN Playlists p ON pt.PlaylistID = p.PlaylistID
JOIN Artists a ON t.ArtistID = a.ArtistID
WHERE p.Title = 'Chill Hits';


Extending the Schema: Add more entities (e.g., Podcasts, Recommendations) or attributes (e.g., Playlist description) to enhance functionality.
Analysis: Use the schema for data analysis, such as calculating popular genres or analyzing artist follower trends.

Project Insights
This schema supports Spotify’s core features, including:

Personalized Recommendations: Attributes like Genre and Stream_Count enable recommendation algorithms.
Playlist Management: The PlaylistTracks table facilitates dynamic playlist creation.
Artist Exposure: The Artists and Follows tables support artist analytics and fan engagement.
Scalability: Foreign keys and constraints ensure efficient data retrieval for large datasets.
